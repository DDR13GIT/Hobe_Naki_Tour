It presumes that luggage has been delivered undamaged to the Guest unless written notice is given to the TourHobe.com and/or the Carrier:</p>
                    <p >(a) in the case of apparent damage, before or at the time of disembarkation or redelivery; or</p>

The ATourHobe.com&rsquo;s liability will not at any time exceed that of the carrier under its Conditions of Carriage and applicable or incorporated conventions or other legislation.
